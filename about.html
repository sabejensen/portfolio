<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  My name is Sean Jensen and I'm a web development student at Utah Valley University.
  I like reading, writing, and playing guitar. I have very strong opinions about fast
  food restaurants and energy drink brands. When I was in the 8th grade I wanted to be
  a magician, but now I'm trying to be a web developer.

<h3 style="text-align: right;">Education/Career Goals</h3>
<p>
  Right now I'm working on a bachelor's degree in web development. I'm also pursuing
  a minor in Japanese Language. My short term goal
  is to get an internship and expand my skills in the workplace. I have a lot to learn 
  about the industry, but considering where I was when I started my degree I'm very proud
  of my progress thus far. 
  <br><br>
  My short term career goals are to get more practical industry experience, gain more 
  experience working in a team, and improve my resume and skillset. I'm eager to expand
  my technical knowledge and get comfortable with more languages and frameworks. I like
  doing design-oriented tasks and making websites that look nice, but I like doing so 
  from a developer's lens with CSS, rather than just pure design.
  <br><br>
  In the long term, I would love to live abroad and do my own freelance work. One part
  of web development that really appeals to me is the inherent flexibility and mobility.
  I'm open to different paths though. I would love to expand my coding expertise to include
  game development in the future and work on my own projects in that department as well.
