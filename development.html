<p>This project was showcasing a semester's worth of projects for DGM 1600. 
  It dealt with APIs, objects, etc. I was especially proud of how far I came during
  this semester, considering at the beginning I had only a loose grasp on HTML and
  CSS. Generating the anime trading cards with a card flip animation was especially 
  challenging, but it was a very fun project.

<div class="content-wrap"><img src="../images/dev2.png"></img>
<p>
  This project shows my progress with Vue, using APIs and Vue components to generate 
  content for a "Pokédex" app. It uses an API to generate content, and it also uses
  conditionals to process that content, listing either one or two types depending
  on the length of the type array in the API.

  This site uses some very basic HTML and CSS to make a standard and more professional
  looking website. With other classes I found myself exploring fun Javascript mechanics
  or fancy, esoteric bits of CSS. But learning this basic structure has helped a lot if 
  I need to churn out a professional looking website quickly.

  This project started with the basic assets from a Udemy course, but it was up to me
  to add the functionality. Through this project, I gained a much better understanding
  of Vue and utilizing methods, data, etc. And I added some extra touches, like the 
  name entry option at the beginning.
